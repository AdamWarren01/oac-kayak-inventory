**Info:**

-Each kayaks has a name; but w/out knowing them all this may be useless info

-Have a MongoDB named OAC with a new collection that stores 20 kayaks

-User interface should show how many kayaks are available (listed 1, 2, 3, 4,.... 20 vertically)

-Employee interface should allow to mark kayaks as rented/ returned

-^^ by WHOM: name, phone number, L number (listed only on employee side)

-Maybe have to create a collection of employee's that can only be added to by an admin account, and only employees w/ proper creds can login to rent kayaks out or mark as returned

-How long has the kayak been rented/ how long until it is returned

-Will need to be posted to Heroku as well

-Needs to look cool (low priority)

-Commit to branches, try to not use main as much to ensure proper functionality

-Heroku usually deploys one branch at a time, to deploy more than one branch either toggle or pay for heroku membership
